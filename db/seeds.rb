# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# city = City.create({name: "Vi√±a del Mar"},{name: "Valparaiso"},{name: "Quilpue"},{name: "Villa Alemana"},{name: "Limache"},{name: "Olmue"},{name: "ConCon"})

# pet = Pet.create({name: "Perro"},{name: "Gato"},{name: "Hamster"},{name: "Conejo"},{name: "Pez"},{name: "Pajaro"},{name: "Tortuga"})
